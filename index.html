            <p>Welcome to my studio, the place where my creative pursuits go to be seen. In hindshight I probably should have named this 'Cooper's Gallery', but I already bought the domain...</p>
            <p>And besides, all this is still a work in progress. None of my work is ever truly <em>complete</em>, it's just good enough, for now.</p>
            <p>I do a lot of photography, illustration, graphic design, writing, and a smattering of coding, 3d design, and videography, and this little corner of the internet is where I can put all that stuff and let it be known that I created something.</p>
