            <br>
            <p>Jake needed a logo and label for his coffee roasting company. All he had was a name and a catchphrase, so we sat down and talked through some ideas and got to work.</p>
            <img src="../images/desn/jaja/JAJA_portfolioPieces-02.png" alt="An array of explored options for the Java Jake's brand"></a>
            <p>We went through a few different styles and options before settling on one that we both thought would fit the best. From there it was a matter of refining the style and picking colors and fonts. Once Jake was satisfied, it was on to mock-ups, business cards, and finally printing!</p>
