            <h3>A mock branding project that I wish were real</h3>
            <img src="../images/desn/stbr/STBR_v2_MCKP_7Bottle.jpg" alt="A photograph of several bottles arrayed like bowling pins, with labels depicting norse-inspired art for the Storms Brewing brand"></a>
            <p>I have always been enamored with mythology, be it Greek, Norse, Aztec, Chinese, or any number of others — old gods and godesses, mythological creatures, figures of lore and legend.</p>
            <p>I also enjoy craft beer and the world of microbreweries that have sprung up in the last decade. I especially love browsing for cool labels and new flavors. With this project, I had the idea to create a brand that was both new and old.</p>
            <p>Storms Brewing hearkens back to ancient days when ale and mead were cheaper (and safer to drink) than water. The illustrations and style are inspired by Norse mythology and art.</p>
