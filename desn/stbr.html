        <h3>A mock branding project that I wish were real</h3>
        <img src="images/desn/stbr/STBR_v2_MCKP_7Bottle.jpg" alt="3/4 view of bestiary deck and cards"></a>
        <p>I have always been enamored with mythology, be it Greek, Norse, Aztec, Chinese, or any number of others — old gods and godesses, mythological creatures, figures of lore and legend.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy craft beer and the world of microbreweries that have sprung up in the last decade. I especially love browsing for cool labels and new flavors. With this project, I had the idea to create a brand that was both new and old.</p>
        <p>Storms Brewing hearkens back to ancient days when ale and mead were cheaper (and safer to drink) than water. The illustrations and style are inspired by Norse mythology and art.</p>
