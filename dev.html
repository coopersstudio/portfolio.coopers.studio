            <p>I also do a bit of coding and development on the side. I plan to get a few of those projects up on this site eventually.</p>
            <p>Some of my projects include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>This website</li>
                <li>A markov chain name generator (a markov chain is basically a fancy algorithm that puts the most likely combinations of letters together based on a dataset, so it makes things that acutally sound right)</li>
                <li>A note keeping app similar to Google Keep that I designed from scratch (I'm particularly proud of that one)</li>
                <li>A conlang vocabulary generator (a conlang is a 'constructed language'. Tolkien's Elvish is the prime example). Someday I'll put my conlangs up here too, when they're nice and polished</li>
                <li>A library app that allows you to keep track of books you have read, own but haven't read, don't own but want to read, etc.</li>
            </ul>
